# StayHub

StayHub is a full-stack room booking web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, following the MVC architecture. The platform allows property owners to perform backend CRUD operations such as adding, updating, and deleting property listings (rooms, homes, villas). Users can register, log in, book accommodations, and manage favorites â€” all handled through secure session-based authentication and role-based access control.

I developed RESTful APIs for both user and host functionalities, implemented validation and error handling to ensure data integrity, and designed efficient MongoDB schemas to support dynamic filtering and booking logic. The backend also handles authentication workflows and session management, ensuring a secure and seamless experience. The project aligns well with backend development best practices and showcases my skills in building scalable, modular server-side applications using the Node.js ecosystem.
