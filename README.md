# StayHub

StayHub is a full-stack accommodation booking web application built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS, following the MVC architecture. The platform allows property owners to perform backend CRUD operations such as adding, updating, and deleting property listings (rooms, homes, villas). Users can register, log in, book accommodations, and manage favorites â€” all handled through secure session-based authentication and role-based access control.

I developed RESTful APIs for both user and host functionalities, implemented validation and error handling to ensure data integrity, and designed efficient MongoDB schemas to support dynamic filtering and booking logic. The backend handles authentication workflows and session management to ensure a secure and seamless experience.

To give it a full-stack touch, I used EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates) for the frontend, enabling server-side rendering of dynamic views. This allowed seamless integration between backend logic and the UI, ensuring real-time feedback for users and a smoother user experience.

The project aligns well with backend development best practices and showcases my skills in building scalable, modular, and secure server-side applications within the Node.js ecosystem.
